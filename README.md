# REACT VR (introduction) ü¶Ñ

<br>

## SET UP (_first way_) ‚òÅÔ∏è

##### IF YOU HAVE ALL WHAT YOU NEED, the installation will be simple

- Node.js version 6.0.0 or higher
- yarn or npm (>= v3.0.0) package managers

##### Next, install the React VR CLI ‚Äì a command-line tool that generates the basic layout of new projects.

```javascript
// 1
npm install -g react-vr-cli
// Or
yarn global add react-vr-cli
```

##### You'll only need to install this CLI once. It will alert you when it's out of date, and provide instruction on how to update it.

- Once installed, the CLI can be used to create a new project by running

```javascript
// 2
react-vr init PROJECT_NAME
//3
cd PROJECT_NAME
// 4
npm start
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è THE WAY I SET UP MINE ‚òÅÔ∏è

> I never tried React Native so it was a hell of ride for me

- IF I TRIED the set up (_first way_) i will be having this

[<img src="./img/graph_done_dependency_error.jpg"/>]()

- Its a never ending loading

##### Different solutions

[React-native get stuck at Dependency Graph](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34406567/react-native-get-stuck-at-dependency-graph)

##### üêñ

[ npm starts hangs on 'Loading dependency graph, done](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/16798)

##### ü¶Ä

[ Loading dependency graph, done.](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25650)

<br>

#### Luckily I didnt need all that

- What i did was to create a folder called REACT-VR
- inside the folder "REACT-VR" i opened the terminal
- inside the terminal i typed

```javascript
npx react-native init react_vr_intro_1
```

- then after it loads, you should have something like this:

[<img src="./img/result-npmx-native.jpg"/>]()

- after that, type the following:

```javascript
// 1
npm install -g react-vr-cli
// Or
yarn global add react-vr-cli
// 2
react-vr init PROJECT_NAME //(yours)
//3
cd PROJECT_NAME
// 4 grab the url and paste it on the browser
 http://localhost:8081/vr/
//
//  5 then type:
npm start
```

#### Important üêñ

- the errors you see in the image are related to another test i did before, so the new project launched the error clash with the server (due to two apps using it at the same time)

```javascript
 ERROR  Packager can't listen on port 8081
Most likely another process is already using this port
Run the following command to find out which process:

   lsof -i :8081

Then, you can either shut down the other process:

   kill -9 <PID>

or run packager on different port.
