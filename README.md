# REACT VR (introduction) 🦄

## SET UP ☁️

##### IF YOU HAVE ALL WHAT YOU NEED, the installation will be simple

- Node.js version 6.0.0 or higher
- yarn or npm (>= v3.0.0) package managers

##### Next, install the React VR CLI – a command-line tool that generates the basic layout of new projects.

```javascript
// 1
npm install -g react-vr-cli
// Or
yarn global add react-vr-cli
```

##### You'll only need to install this CLI once. It will alert you when it's out of date, and provide instruction on how to update it.

- Once installed, the CLI can be used to create a new project by running

```javascript
// 2
react-vr init PROJECT_NAME
```
